# Foodsource | Crowd Sourcing Project

Developed as a group project for an HCI class built to employ the crowd in supplying recipe advice and suggestions to other users looking for recipes based on their needs. The web application was developed after conducting intensive user research and the data was populated through a crowdsourcing platform. The actual application was built using ruby on rails for backend work and foundations for frontend.
